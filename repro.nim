## Reprobuild dev env + build recipe for codetracer-solana-recorder.
##
## Mirrors the dev shell declared in ``flake.nix`` (Linux/macOS) and
## the Windows DIY env declared in ``env.ps1``. ``repro build`` /
## ``repro test`` reproduce the same artefacts and the same test set
## that ``just build`` / ``just test`` produce today.
##
## Per ``codetracer-specs/Repo-Requirements.md`` §2.8 the recipe
## expresses build and test execution NATIVELY through typed-tool
## edges (`cargo.build`, `cargo.test`). It does NOT delegate to
## `shell(command = "bash scripts/...")` wrappers — delegation
## defeats the engine's incremental-build, action-cache, per-test
## invalidation, and the CI sharding the engine grows into per
## ``reprobuild-specs/CI-Sharding.md``.
##
## On Windows the recipe drives real reprobuild tool provisioning via
## the tarball entries the ``uses:`` packages declare (cargo, rustc,
## rustfmt, nim, nimble, capnp). On Linux/macOS the Nix flake
## continues to supply the same toolchain. Either path produces
## byte-equivalent build outputs and the same test pass/fail set —
## CI cross-checks this through the side-by-side `ci.yml` (nix) +
## `ci-reprobuild.yml` (reprobuild) flow per Repo-Requirements §2.9.
##
## Solana: test corpus is pre-compiled SBPF .so artefacts.
